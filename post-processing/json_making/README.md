# Each script and its purpose

## `Clean.py`
 The purpose of this script is to take the output from
 Read.sh and clean it up such that each line is an orbital


## `Maker.py`
 The purpose of this script is to take the output from Clean.py
 and compile it into a singular JSON file that can be used for
 other purposes.

## `Read.sh`
 The purpose of this script is to read the Gaussian log files
 and then capture the near-gap orbitals reported.

 `summary_of_1101_snapshots.json` is an example output from the above scripts.
