This folder contains the datsets used to train the models ML models to validate feature accuracy, and the breakdown of the physical features into the 7 different categories described in figure 5.

`final_mulliken.csv` includes all the data used to train the model on only Mulliken charges

`hydrophic_core.csv` inlcudes the physical features associated with the backbone (figure 5 number 1,2)

`charges_and_dipoles.csv` inlcudes the physical features associated with the charged groups (figure 5 number 3,4)

`backbone.csv` inlcudes the physical features associated with the backbone (figure 5 number 5,6)
