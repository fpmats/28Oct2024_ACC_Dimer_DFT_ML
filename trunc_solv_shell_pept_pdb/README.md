Truncating Solvation Shell of a peptide pdb file from MD in aqueous solvent with counter ions

## Dependencies

This requires the `make` program and a FORTRAN90 compiler, 
with no special features used, thus most versions of make
and other compilers should work.

## Compile

- run `make`
- binary program `extract` will be in this directory
- call `${this_directory}/extract --help` to see options for using the program
